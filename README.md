## Doctrine integration in Laravel.

The purpose of this repose is only educative.

I try to make Doctrine ORM work with Laravel instead of the standard build-in ORM; Eloquent, while enabling as many features of Laravel as possible (authentication, authorization, Octane, Passport, etc ..) Some features of Laravel are tightly coupled with the standard ORM, so those will be skipped.

### Feature wishlist:
